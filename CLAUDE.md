# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server (localhost:4321)
npm run build     # Production build — always run after changes to verify no errors
npm run preview   # Preview the production build locally
```

There are no test or lint scripts. Use `npm run build` as the verification step — it runs TypeScript checks and Vite bundling. Build errors from ECONNREFUSED are expected (local API not running) and do not block deployment.

## Architecture

**Stack:** Astro 6 (server output) + React 19 (islands) + Tailwind CSS v4 + Cloudflare Pages.

**Backend:** Separate repo at `/Users/hafiz/Developments/hono-workers` — a Hono API on Cloudflare Workers with D1 (SQLite) and KV. The portfolio fetches from it at `PUBLIC_API_URL` (`.env`: `http://localhost:8787/api/v1`; production: `https://hono-workers.hafizbahtiar98.workers.dev/api/v1`).

### Rendering model

The project uses SSR (`output: "server"`) via `@astrojs/cloudflare`. Pages that need to be pre-rendered at build time use `export const prerender = true`. This avoids build-time fetch errors (ECONNREFUSED) by deferring data fetching to request time for non-prerendered pages, while still allowing static generation for others.

### Data flow

`src/lib/*.ts` — service classes that extend `ApiClient` (in `src/lib/api-client.ts`). Each service maps to an API resource (family, projects, blog, experiences, etc.). The `ApiClient` handles token refresh (httpOnly `refresh_token` cookie + in-memory `_accessToken`). Public endpoints need no auth; admin endpoints require a Bearer token obtained via `AuthService`.

### Layouts

- `CoreLayout.astro` — root HTML shell, injects theme-init script (reads `localStorage("theme")`, adds `.dark` to `<html>`), uses Astro `<ClientRouter>` for SPA transitions.
- `PublicLayout.astro` — wraps CoreLayout with `Navbar`, `Footer`, `Background`.
- `PrivateLayout.astro` — wraps CoreLayout with `AdminSidebar`, `AdminNavbar`. Forces always-dark via `class="... bg-[#0f172a] dark"` on the flex container — never remove this or the admin UI breaks.
- `ProjectLayout.astro` — thin wrapper for the projects listing page.

### Dark mode

Tailwind v4 with `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` in `src/styles/index.css`. The `.dark` class is toggled on `<html>` by the inline script in `CoreLayout`. Admin is always dark (locked via PrivateLayout). Use the established slate palette:

```
text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-100       (headings)
text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400       (body / labels)
bg-white dark:bg-slate-800               (card backgrounds)
border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700   (card borders)
border-slate-300 dark:border-slate-600   (input borders)
```

Accent color is **cyan** (`cyan-400/500`) for interactive elements, **blue** for buttons/CTAs.

### UI components (`src/components/ui/`)

Custom Astro components with their own inline `<script>` blocks that set up event listeners. Key pattern: each component calls a `setup*()` function on load and re-registers on `astro:page-load`. Components expose `window.setup*()` globals so pages can trigger re-init after dynamic content.

- `Dropdown.astro` — single-select. Hidden `<input type="hidden">` stores value. Items must have a `<span>` wrapping the label text (required by the change-listener that reads `querySelector("span")?.textContent`).
- `MultiDropdown.astro` — multi-select, stores JSON array in hidden input.
- `Checkbox.astro` — styled toggle button over a hidden `<input type="checkbox">`.
- `DateInput.astro` — styled date input.
- `Select.tsx` — React equivalent of Dropdown for use inside React components.

### Family tree (`src/components/family/`)

Uses the `family-chart` library with light/dark theme overrides in `src/styles/family-chart-theme.css`.

Public pages use `FamilyExplorer.tsx` as a single React island. Data is fetched in Astro frontmatter at request time and passed as props; selection, search, deep links, zoom, orientation, list fallback, and details are all props/state-driven. `src/hooks/useFamilyChart.ts` owns public chart lifecycle and uses the library's real d3 zoom handlers.

`FamilyTreeChart.tsx` is now the legacy/admin chart wrapper. It still uses `h-full w-full` and must sit inside a parent with a fixed height. It retains the admin window-event contract:

- `family:set-main` → moves chart focus to a person
- `family:on-main-changed` → fired by chart when main person changes (guard against infinite loop: check `if (mainInput.value === String(id)) return` before re-dispatching)
- `family:zoom-in/out`, `family:fit`, `family:center-main`, `family:set-orientation`

The shared chart data transform lives in `src/lib/chart-data.ts`.

### Public family pages (`src/pages/family/`)

`family/index.astro` and `family/[slug]/index.astro` use `prerender = false` and fetch public family data at request time through `src/lib/family.ts`. Public family fetches intentionally avoid `noCache` query params and avoid the shared no-store `ApiClient` path so the backend's KV/HTTP cache remains effective.

`/family` builds the combined view server-side via `src/lib/family-merge.ts` and `src/data/family.ts`. Keep `/family` unlisted from the public navbar unless the privacy decision changes.

Before public family data is passed to React islands, `src/lib/family-privacy.ts` maps backend data into a strict public DTO. It strips notes, metadata, timestamps, tree IDs, relationship IDs, relationship dates, and admin/backend fields, and sanitizes living-person birth dates to year-only strings so full living birth dates are not serialized to the browser.

### `container-main`

Defined in `src/styles/index.css` as `max-w-[794px] mx-auto px-6 md:px-10`. All public page content should use this class.
