# Family Page Diagnosis & Redesign Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Turn the public Family pages (`/family`, `/family/[slug]`) into a polished, server-rendered, responsive, accessible family-tree experience — removing the window-event/global-variable architecture, hardcoded data patches, cache-busting, and fake zoom, while keeping the admin family module working unchanged.

**Architecture:** Fetch family data server-side in Astro frontmatter (request-time SSR on Cloudflare, leaning on the API's KV + HTTP cache) and pass it as props to a single React island per page (`FamilyExplorer`) that owns toolbar, chart, search, person detail, and a mobile list fallback. The `family-chart` rendering core is extracted into a `useFamilyChart` hook shared by the new public explorer and the existing admin `FamilyTreeChart` wrapper.

**Tech Stack:** Astro 6 (SSR, `output: "server"`), React 19 islands, Tailwind CSS v4, `family-chart` 0.9.0 (d3-based), Hono + D1 backend (separate repo, mostly untouched).

## Part A — Diagnosis

### A1. Current state summary

**Files involved today**

| Area | File | Lines | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public page | `src/pages/family/index.astro` | 375 | Combined-family page; client-side fetch + 150-line inline merge script |
| Public page | `src/pages/family/[slug]/index.astro` | 414 | Single-tree page; Astro Dropdowns populated via `innerHTML` injection |
| Component | `src/components/family/FamilyTreeChart.tsx` | 762 | Monolith: data transform + chart lifecycle + window-event bus + cross-tree navigation + inline-edit wiring |
| Component | `src/components/family/PublicFamilyExplorer.tsx` | 115 | Fetch-then-render wrapper used only on `[slug]` page |
| Component | `src/components/family/CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx` | 188 | **Unused on any page** — duplicate of the merge script in `index.astro` |
| Component | `src/components/family/PersonInfoPanel.tsx` | 118 | Reads selection from window events + `window.__familyDetail` |
| Service | `src/lib/family.ts` | 139 | `FamilyService` — public + admin endpoints, forces `noCache=1&_=Date.now()` on every public call |
| Types | `src/types/family.ts` | 100 | Clean, matches backend |
| Admin | `src/components/admin/family/*` (4 files) | ~2,800 | Tree CRUD + visual builder; reuses `FamilyTreeChart` |
| Backend | `hono-workers/src/routes/v1/public/family.ts` | — | KV-cached (120 s TTL) public endpoints with `Cache-Control: max-age=60, SWR 600` |
| Backend | `hono-workers/src/database/schemas/family_chart.sql` | — | `family_trees` / `family_people` / `family_relationships` |

**Headline problems**

1. **Three communication mechanisms used at once** — React props, `window` CustomEvents (`family:set-main`, `family:set-data`, `family:on-main-changed`, `family:on-spouses`, `family:zoom-*`, …), and window globals (`window.__combinedFamilyDetail`, `window.__familyDetail`, `window.familyChartApi`). Zoom/fit/center logic is implemented **twice** inside `FamilyTreeChart.tsx` (once on `window.familyChartApi`, once as event listeners).
2. **Personal data hardcoded in code** — `addParentRelIfMissing("Mohd Bahtiar", "Muhamad Nurhafiz")`, `addParentRelIfMissing("Zarina", …)`, and "muhamad nurhafiz" centering live in *two* places (`index.astro` script and `CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx`). Data fixes belong in the database.
3. **The entire combined-merge algorithm is duplicated** (~140 lines) between the inline `<script>` of `index.astro` and the unused `CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx`. They have already drifted (different descriptions).
4. **Every public fetch busts every cache** — `withNoCache` appends `noCache=1&_=Date.now()`, which skips the backend KV cache **and** makes the URL unique so browser/CDN HTTP caching is impossible. The backend's caching design is fully defeated by its only consumer.
5. **Pages are `prerender = false` but fetch client-side anyway** — worst of both worlds: SSR cost without SSR benefit, plus loading skeletons, race guards (`familyLoadRunning`), and FOUC. (CLAUDE.md still claims these pages prerender at build time — stale.)
6. **Fake zoom** — the +/− buttons change `setCardXSpacing/setCardYSpacing` (node spacing) instead of zooming. The library exports real programmatic zoom (`handlers.manualZoom`, `zoomTo`); native wheel/pinch zoom already works on the canvas, so buttons and gestures disagree about what "zoom" means.
7. **Cross-tree navigation is an N+1 storm** — every card click with no `globalKey` fetches **all trees + all tree details** (each cache-busted) just to decide whether to jump trees. This also runs in the admin builder (`enableCrossTreeNavigation` defaults to `true`). With the combined view existing, this feature is redundant.
8. **Orphan page** — `/family` is not linked from the public Navbar (Projects/Skills/Experience only). See Open Decisions.
9. **Debug artifacts in production UI** — yellow "Live data will be loaded in the browser for this family." banner on `[slug]`; `console.error`-only failure paths.
10. **CLAUDE.md drift** — rendering model and family sections describe behavior that no longer matches the code.

### A2. Package / library analysis — `family-chart` 0.9.0

- **Identity:** `family-chart` by donatso, v0.9.0 — which is the **latest published version** (verified via npm). D3.js-based, TypeScript types shipped, MIT/ISC-style licensed.
- **Size:** ESM bundle 220 KB raw (106 KB min) **plus** a hard dependency on full `d3` v7 (~870 KB unpacked). It is already loaded via dynamic `import("family-chart")` inside the component, so it's code-split and only downloaded on family pages. CSS is imported statically (fine, tiny).
- **SSR:** Not SSR-compatible (touches DOM/d3 on import path usage); must stay a client island with dynamic import — current usage is correct on this point.

**Capability matrix vs. requirements**

| Requirement | Supported? | Notes / current usage |
|---|---|---|
| Zoom / pan | ✅ native d3 wheel/drag/pinch + `handlers.manualZoom({amount, svg})`, `zoomTo(svg, level)`, `getCurrentZoom` | **Misused** — buttons change card spacing instead |
| Expand / collapse | ⚠️ partial | Global `setAncestryDepth` / `setProgenyDepth`; `setDuplicateBranchToggle`; **no true per-branch collapse API** |
| Spouse / children rels | ✅ | `rels: {parents, spouses, children}` — correctly mapped from the relationship edge list |
| Multiple generations | ✅ | depth-limited; currently 6/5 on combined view |
| Mobile responsiveness | ⚠️ | Canvas resizes; touch pan/pinch work; cards/controls are our responsibility |
| Custom node UI | ✅ | `setCardHtml()`, `setStyle("imageCircleRect" \| "imageCircle" \| …)`, `setCardImageField("avatar")`, `setDefaultPersonIcon`, `setOnCardUpdate` — **avatars currently unused** (`label`-only cards) |
| Search | ✅ built-in `setPersonDropdown` | unused; we'll build our own combobox for styling/a11y consistency |
| Kinship labels | ✅ `calculateKinships(id)` | unused — would give "relationship to main" labels for free |
| Privacy | ✅ `setPrivateCardsConfig` | unused |
| Lazy / large-tree perf | ⚠️ | No virtualization; fine for this dataset (3 trees, ~30 people seeded); depth limits are the lever |
| SSR w/ Astro | ❌ by design | dynamic import already in place ✅ |

**Verdict: keep `family-chart`.** It is current, capable, and *under*-used — the problems are in our integration, not the library. Alternatives (react-family-tree, relatives-tree, GoJS, yFiles) are either abandoned, can't model spouses+multi-generation as well, or are commercial. Replacement is not justified.

### A3. UI/UX diagnosis

| Area | Finding |
|---|---|
| Layout | `[slug]`: `flex gap-4 h-[580px]` with fixed `w-64` side panel — panel never collapses; on a 375 px phone the chart gets ~90 px. Fixed 580 px heights everywhere regardless of viewport. |
| Visual hierarchy | Toolbar on `[slug]` is a flat row of 8 same-weight buttons ("Vertical Horizontal − + Center Main Fit") with no grouping or icons. |
| Card design | Label-only dark cards; no avatars, no birth years on combined view, no deceased indicator, no "you are here" affordance. |
| Empty states | Decent on `index` ("Family data unavailable"); `[slug]` has none for the chart itself. |
| Loading states | `index` has skeletons (only needed because fetching is client-side); `[slug]` shows raw slug as title + "Loading family details..." text that can stick forever on error. |
| Error states | Generic red box; no retry; `[slug]` can show error box *and* stale toolbar simultaneously. |
| Responsive | Toolbar buttons wrap awkwardly; side panel fixed-width; no mobile alternative view. |
| Dark/light | Chart canvas is **always dark** (`--color-family-canvas: #212121`) inside a light page — jarring in light mode. family-chart ships dark-styled cards only. |
| Mobile usability | Pinch/pan works (library), but +/− buttons do spacing-not-zoom; person info panel unreachable (squeezed); dropdowns are desktop-sized. |
| Accessibility | Buttons labeled literally "+" / "−" with no `aria-label`; dropdown options injected as raw HTML strings; no focus management; no keyboard path to select a person; no reduced-motion handling (1000 ms transitions). |
| Touch gestures | Native d3 pinch-zoom OK; no affordance hinting the canvas is interactive. |
| Large-tree readability | Depth caps exist (good); no search-to-person (must hunt by panning); no breadcrumb of who is "main". |
| Consistency | Yellow debug banner; mixed Astro-Dropdown + React islands on one toolbar; the rest of the portfolio is clean slate/cyan — family pages feel like a lab. |

### A4. Functional gap list

| Concern | Status today |
|---|---|
| Missing profile photos | No avatars rendered at all (label-only cards); `PersonInfoPanel` shows no photo either |
| Unknown members | `gender: "unknown"` maps to `"M"` silently in `mapGender` |
| Duplicate names | Combined merge **keys people by lowercased displayName** when `globalKey` is missing → two relatives with the same name get merged into one person (data corruption in the view) |
| Spouse rels | ✅ mapped; "No Spouse" filter exists ([slug] only) |
| Parent-child rels | ✅ mapped incl. adoptive; **sibling rows in DB are accepted by the API but never rendered** (library derives siblings from shared parents only) |
| Deceased/living | In data + info panel; not on cards |
| Search/filter | ❌ none (library support exists) |
| Zoom/reset | ⚠️ fake zoom; Fit exists; no reset-to-default |
| Expand/collapse branch | ❌ only fixed depth props; no UI control |
| Person detail panel | Desktop-only, event-coupled, no photo, no kinship label, race-prone (`window.__familyDetail` may arrive after first event) |
| Shareable link | ❌ no `?person=` deep link; main-person selection lost on reload |
| Mobile fallback view | ❌ none |
| Large-tree perf | Acceptable now; cross-tree N+1 is the real perf bug |
| Invalid/malformed data | Relationship endpoints referencing missing people are skipped (good); cyclic data unguarded (library may hang — low risk, admin-controlled data) |
| Empty family data | Handled on `index`; partial on `[slug]` |

### A5. Data model review

The backend model (`family_trees`, `family_people`, `family_relationships` edge table) is **sound and scalable** — people and typed directional relationships with `UNIQUE(tree_id, person_id, related_person_id, relationship_type)` and proper FKs/indexes. Keep it. Gaps, in priority order:

1. **`global_key` is the cross-tree identity but is optional** → display-name fallback merging (duplicate-name hazard, hardcoded patches). *Fix: backfill `global_key` for every person appearing in >1 tree, and add the missing bridge relationships as data (Phase 0).* Long-term: make it NOT NULL.
2. **`birth_order` lives in untyped `metadata` JSON (sometimes string-encoded)** — the chart sorter has to try/catch-parse it. *Recommended (optional backend phase): promote to `birth_order INTEGER` column.*
3. **No per-person privacy** — full names + birth years of living relatives are public. *Recommended (optional backend phase): `visibility TEXT CHECK(visibility IN ('public','members','private')) DEFAULT 'public'` + filter in the public service; frontend pairs with `setPrivateCardsConfig`.* Until then, an interim frontend rule (hide exact birth dates of living people, show year only) is included in Phase 3.
4. **Relationship direction convention is implicit** (`parent`: personId=parent → relatedPersonId=child; `child` rows are the inverse duplicate). Document it; the transform already handles both.

Frontend `FamilyPerson` / `FamilyRelationship` types are fine as-is; no changes needed beyond what the new components consume.

### A6. Performance review

| Issue | Impact | Fix (phase) |
|---|---|---|
| `noCache=1&_=Date.now()` on all public fetches | Defeats KV + HTTP + CDN caching; every visit hits D1 | Remove cache-busters (P1) |
| Client-side waterfall: page → trees list → N tree details | 1+N sequential-ish round trips before first paint of the tree | SSR fetch in frontmatter; one HTML response with data inlined (P1) |
| Cross-tree nav fetch storm per card click | N+1 requests per click, also in admin | Delete the feature (P2) |
| Combined merge runs in every browser | CPU + duplicated code | Merge once per request on the server (P1) |
| `FamilyTreeChart` island mounted (hidden) before data exists | Hydrates React + listeners for nothing | Single island receives data as props (P3) |
| `family-chart`+d3 in initial island chunk | already dynamic-imported ✅ keep | — |
| Avatars (when added) | — | `loading="lazy"`, fixed dims, R2 URLs (P3) |
| 1000 ms tree transitions | Feels sluggish; ignores reduced-motion | 300 ms default; 0 when `prefers-reduced-motion` (P3/P4) |

## Part B — Proposed design

### B1. Page layout

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **`/family`** = combined tree (default experience) + tabs linking to each individual tree page.
- **`/family/[slug]`** = same explorer, single tree, back link.
- Empty/error states are **server-rendered** (no skeleton needed for data; only the chart canvas shows a brief mount placeholder).

### B2. Component & folder structure

```
src/
  data/family.ts                      # combined-view config (slug, title, main person globalKey)
  lib/family.ts                       # service — withNoCache removed
  lib/family-merge.ts                 # pure mergeFamilyTrees() (server-side)
  components/family/
    FamilyExplorer.tsx                # island root: state, layout, URL sync
    FamilyToolbar.tsx                 # search, view toggle, orientation, zoom, fit/reset
    PersonSearch.tsx                  # accessible combobox over people
    PersonDetailPanel.tsx             # photo, dates, notes, clickable relations (panel/bottom-sheet)
    FamilyListView.tsx                # mobile/a11y fallback list
    FamilyTreeCanvas.tsx              # thin mount point using useFamilyChart
    useFamilyChart.ts                 # chart lifecycle hook (create/update/destroy, api ref)
    chart-data.ts                     # buildChartData() transform (moved out of FamilyTreeChart)
    FamilyTreeChart.tsx               # SLIMMED legacy wrapper — admin only, same props/events
  styles/family-chart-theme.css      # .f3 light/dark token overrides
  pages/family/index.astro            # SSR fetch + merge → <FamilyExplorer client:load />
  pages/family/[slug]/index.astro     # SSR fetch → <FamilyExplorer client:load />
```

Deleted at the end of Phase 4: `CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx`, `PublicFamilyExplorer.tsx`, `PersonInfoPanel.tsx`.

**State flow (public pages):** Astro frontmatter fetch → `detail` prop → `FamilyExplorer` React state (`selectedPersonId`, `view`, `orientation`) → `useFamilyChart` api ref. No window events, no globals. Admin keeps the existing `FamilyTreeChart` event contract untouched.

### B3. Mobile / responsive strategy

- Grid `lg:grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)_300px]`; below `lg` the person panel becomes a bottom sheet (fixed, `translate-y` transition, Escape/backdrop closes).
- Canvas `h-[65vh] min-h-[420px] lg:h-[580px]`; native pinch/pan retained.
- Toolbar: icon buttons with labels hidden below `sm` (`aria-label` always set); search full-width row on mobile.
- **List view** toggle = guaranteed-usable fallback: searchable person cards (avatar, name, years, relation count) → tap opens detail sheet. Also the accessible alternative to the SVG canvas.

### B4. Light / dark mode strategy

- Replace single `--color-family-canvas: #212121` with themed tokens in `index.css` (`:root` light values, `.dark` overrides).
- New `family-chart-theme.css` overrides `.f3` card/link/text classes using those tokens so cards follow the site palette (white/slate-800 cards, cyan accent for main person, slate links).
- Buttons/panels reuse the documented slate/cyan palette from CLAUDE.md.

### B5. Performance strategy

Summarized from A6: SSR data + props (zero client data fetching on happy path), caches restored (KV 120 s + `max-age=60, SWR 600` now actually used), merge on server, one island, dynamic-import chart kept, cross-tree storm deleted, lazy avatars, 300 ms/0 ms transitions.

### B6. Accessibility checklist (acceptance criteria for Phase 4)

- [ ] All toolbar controls have `aria-label` + visible `focus-visible` ring
- [ ] Search is a real combobox (`role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, arrow-key + Enter, `aria-activedescendant`)
- [ ] Person detail sheet: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, focus moved in on open, returned on close, Escape closes
- [ ] List view reachable by keyboard; every person focusable; selection works without pointer
- [ ] Canvas region has `role="application"` + `aria-label="Interactive family tree"`; List view referenced as alternative
- [ ] Avatars have meaningful `alt` (person name); decorative icons `aria-hidden`
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` → chart transitions 0 ms, sheet transition none
- [ ] Color contrast AA for card text on themed backgrounds (check light mode especially)
- [ ] No information conveyed by color alone (deceased = label, not just dimming)

---

## Part C — Implementation phases

> **Verification baseline:** this project has no test runner or linter. Per CLAUDE.md, `npm run build` (runs `@astrojs/check` TypeScript checks + Vite bundling) is the verification step, plus manual checks against `npm run dev`. ECONNREFUSED build noise is expected when the local API isn't running. Work happens on the `dev` branch (current branch, clean); **no push to main**.

### Phase 0 — Data fix in D1 (hono-workers) — *prerequisite, no code changes*

**Files:** none in portfolio-astro; SQL run against hono-workers D1 (local first, then remote).

- [ ] **Step 0.1: Inventory cross-tree identities and the missing bridge relationships**

Run (in `/Users/hafiz/Developments/hono-workers`):

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute hono_workers_db --local --command \
"SELECT p.id, p.tree_id, t.slug, p.display_name, p.global_key
 FROM family_people p JOIN family_trees t ON t.id = p.tree_id
 ORDER BY lower(p.display_name), p.tree_id;"
```

Expected: every person appearing in more than one tree (e.g. Muhamad Nurhafiz, Mohd Bahtiar, Zarina) shares the same non-null `global_key`. List any row where duplicates have NULL/differing keys.

- [ ] **Step 0.2: Backfill missing `global_key`s** (template — substitute real IDs from 0.1)

```sql
UPDATE family_people SET global_key = 'muhamad-nurhafiz' WHERE id IN (<ids>);
UPDATE family_people SET global_key = 'mohd-bahtiar'     WHERE id IN (<ids>);
UPDATE family_people SET global_key = 'zarina'           WHERE id IN (<ids>);
```

- [ ] **Step 0.3: Add the bridge relationships as data** (replaces the hardcoded `addParentRelIfMissing` calls). In whichever tree holds all three people (expected: hafiz-family, tree_id `<T>`):

```sql
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO family_relationships
  (tree_id, person_id, related_person_id, relationship_type, is_primary)
VALUES
  (<T>, <id of Mohd Bahtiar in T>, <id of Muhamad Nurhafiz in T>, 'parent', 1),
  (<T>, <id of Zarina in T>,        <id of Muhamad Nurhafiz in T>, 'parent', 1);
```

- [ ] **Step 0.4: Verify, then repeat 0.2–0.3 with `--remote`**

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute hono_workers_db --local --command \
"SELECT * FROM family_relationships WHERE relationship_type='parent' AND related_person_id IN (<hafiz ids>);"
```

Expected: both parent rows present. Then run the same statements with `--remote`. (KV cache TTL is 120 s — changes appear publicly within 2 minutes.)

---

### Phase 1 — Server-side data layer

#### Task 1: Remove cache-busting from the public family service

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/lib/family.ts:16-44`

- [ ] **Step 1.1: Delete `withNoCache` and use plain endpoints**

Replace lines 16–44 of `src/lib/family.ts` with:

```ts
export class FamilyService extends ApiClient {
  constructor() {
    super(API_BASE_URL);
  }

  async getPublicTrees(): Promise<FamilyTree[]> {
    const result = await this.get<FamilyTree[]>("family");
    return result || [];
  }

  async getPublicTreeBySlug(slug: string): Promise<FamilyTreeDetail | null> {
    return this.get<FamilyTreeDetail>(`family/${slug}`);
  }

  async getPublicPersonById(id: number): Promise<FamilyPerson | null> {
    return this.get<FamilyPerson>(`family/person/${id}`);
  }

  async getPublicTreesByGlobalKey(key: string): Promise<FamilyTree[]> {
    const result = await this.get<FamilyTree[]>(
      `family/trees-by-global/${encodeURIComponent(key)}`,
    );
    return result || [];
  }
```

(The `const withNoCache = …` block at the top of the file is deleted; everything from `getAdminTrees()` down is unchanged.)

- [ ] **Step 1.2: Verify no other callers**

Run: `grep -rn "withNoCache\|noCache" src/`
Expected: only hits left are in `src/pages/family/*.astro` (removed in Tasks 3–4).

- [ ] **Step 1.3: Build check**

Run: `npm run build`
Expected: completes with no TypeScript errors (ECONNREFUSED warnings OK).

- [ ] **Step 1.4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/family.ts
git commit -m "perf(family): stop cache-busting public family API calls"
```

#### Task 2: Extract the combined-merge into a pure server-side module + config

**Files:**
- Create: `src/data/family.ts`
- Create: `src/lib/family-merge.ts`

- [ ] **Step 2.1: Create `src/data/family.ts`**

```ts
/** Configuration for the synthesized combined family view on /family. */
export const COMBINED_FAMILY = {
  slug: "combined-family",
  name: "Big Family (Combined)",
  description:
    "Combined view of Hafiz, Bahtiar, and Azhari families, centered for full ancestry.",
  /** globalKey of the person the combined view centers on (must exist in D1). */
  mainPersonGlobalKey: "muhamad-nurhafiz",
} as const;
```

- [ ] **Step 2.2: Create `src/lib/family-merge.ts`**

This is the algorithm from `CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx:6-152`, made pure, with the hardcoded `addParentRelIfMissing` name patches **removed** (Phase 0 moved them into data) and main-person selection driven by `globalKey`:

```ts
import type {
  FamilyPerson,
  FamilyRelationship,
  FamilyTreeDetail,
} from "../types/family";

export interface CombinedFamilyConfig {
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  mainPersonGlobalKey: string;
}

const personKey = (p: FamilyPerson) => {
  const gk = (p.globalKey || "").trim().toLowerCase();
  if (gk.length > 0) return gk;
  // Fallback for people without a globalKey. Same-named people without
  // keys WILL be merged — Phase 0 backfills keys to prevent this.
  return p.displayName.trim().toLowerCase();
};

/** Merge multiple public tree details into one synthetic combined detail. */
export function mergeFamilyTrees(
  details: FamilyTreeDetail[],
  config: CombinedFamilyConfig,
): FamilyTreeDetail {
  const personByKey = new Map<string, FamilyPerson>();
  const keyToNewId = new Map<string, number>();
  let nextId = 1;

  for (const d of details) {
    for (const p of d.people) {
      const key = personKey(p);
      const existing = personByKey.get(key);
      if (!existing) {
        personByKey.set(key, { ...p, id: nextId, treeId: 0 });
        keyToNewId.set(key, nextId);
        nextId += 1;
      } else {
        existing.firstName = existing.firstName ?? p.firstName ?? null;
        existing.lastName = existing.lastName ?? p.lastName ?? null;
        existing.photoUrl = existing.photoUrl ?? p.photoUrl ?? null;
        existing.notes = existing.notes ?? p.notes ?? null;
        existing.gender =
          existing.gender === "unknown" ? p.gender : existing.gender;
        existing.birthDate = existing.birthDate ?? p.birthDate ?? null;
        existing.deathDate = existing.deathDate ?? p.deathDate ?? null;
        existing.isLiving = existing.isLiving || p.isLiving;
        existing.metadata = existing.metadata ?? p.metadata ?? null;
      }
    }
  }

  const combinedPeople = Array.from(personByKey.values());

  const relKey = (r: Pick<FamilyRelationship, "relationshipType" | "personId" | "relatedPersonId">) =>
    `${r.relationshipType}:${r.personId}->${r.relatedPersonId}`;

- [ ] **Step 2.3: Build check**

Run: `npm run build` — Expected: clean type check.

- [ ] **Step 2.4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/data/family.ts src/lib/family-merge.ts
git commit -m "feat(family): extract pure server-side tree merge with config-driven main person"
```

### Phase 2 — Chart core refactor (shared with admin)

#### Task 3: Extract `buildChartData` into `chart-data.ts`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/family/chart-data.ts`
- Modify: `src/components/family/FamilyTreeChart.tsx:32-119` (delete moved code, import instead)

- [ ] **Step 3.1: Create `src/components/family/chart-data.ts`** — move `mapGender`, `splitDisplayName`, `buildChartData` verbatim from `FamilyTreeChart.tsx:32-119`, exporting all three, with one behavior fix: keep gender `"unknown"`/`"other"` out of the `F` bucket but record the original on data for the detail panel (the library only accepts M/F):

```ts
import type { Data } from "family-chart";
import type { FamilyTreeDetail } from "../../types/family";

export const mapGender = (gender: string): "M" | "F" =>
  gender === "female" ? "F" : "M";

export const splitDisplayName = (displayName: string) => {
  const parts = displayName.trim().split(/\s+/);
  if (parts.length <= 1) return { firstName: displayName.trim(), lastName: "" };
  return { firstName: parts[0], lastName: parts.slice(1).join(" ") };
};

export const buildChartData = (detail: FamilyTreeDetail): Data => {
  // …identical body to FamilyTreeChart.tsx:48-119 (person map, relationship
  // mapping incl. adoptive types, de-dup of rels arrays)…
};
```

(Copy the existing body exactly; it is correct. Only the imports/exports are new.)

- [ ] **Step 3.2: Update `FamilyTreeChart.tsx`** — delete lines 32–119, add `import { buildChartData } from "./chart-data";`.

- [ ] **Step 3.3: Build check** — `npm run build`, expected clean.

- [ ] **Step 3.4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/family/chart-data.ts src/components/family/FamilyTreeChart.tsx
git commit -m "refactor(family): extract chart data transform into chart-data.ts"
```

#### Task 4: Delete cross-tree navigation from `FamilyTreeChart`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/components/family/FamilyTreeChart.tsx` (remove lines ~420–540 cross-tree block, `enableCrossTreeNavigation` prop/refs, and the now-unused `getPublicFamilyTree*` imports)

- [ ] **Step 4.1: Remove the feature** — in `setOnCardClick`, everything after the `family:on-spouses` dispatch and `addRelative` call (the `if (!enableCrossTreeNavigationRef.current)` block through the end of the handler) is deleted. Delete the prop, its ref, its effect, and imports `getPublicFamilyTreeBySlug, getPublicFamilyTrees, getPublicFamilyTreesByGlobalKey` from `../../lib/family`.

- [ ] **Step 4.2: Check call sites**

Run: `grep -rn "enableCrossTreeNavigation" src/`
Expected: zero hits after edit (admin never passed it explicitly — verified: `FamilyManager.tsx:609`, `FamilyTreeBuilder.tsx:1159` pass other props only).

- [ ] **Step 4.3: Build + admin smoke test**

Run: `npm run build`; then `npm run dev`, open `/admin/family`, edit a tree in the builder, click cards. Expected: selection/centering still work; **no** network requests to `/family?…` on card clicks (check devtools Network).

- [ ] **Step 4.4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/family/FamilyTreeChart.tsx
git commit -m "perf(family): remove cross-tree navigation fetch storm from chart"
```

#### Task 5: Create `useFamilyChart` hook

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/family/useFamilyChart.ts`

- [ ] **Step 5.1: Write the hook**

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import type { Chart, Data } from "family-chart";

  useEffect(() => { onSelectRef.current = onSelect; }, [onSelect]);

  const t = prefersReducedMotion() ? 0 : 300;

  // create once
  useEffect(() => {
    const container = containerRef.current;
    if (!container || data.length === 0 || chartRef.current) return;
    let destroyed = false;

    (async () => {
      const f3 = await import("family-chart");
      if (destroyed || !containerRef.current) return;
      handlersRef.current = f3.handlers;
      container.innerHTML = "";

      const chart = f3.createChart(container, data)
        .setTransitionTime(t)
        .setCardXSpacing(250)
        .setCardYSpacing(150)
        .setShowSiblingsOfMain(showSiblings ?? true)
        .setDuplicateBranchToggle(true);
      if (typeof ancestryDepth === "number") chart.setAncestryDepth(ancestryDepth);
      if (typeof progenyDepth === "number") chart.setProgenyDepth(progenyDepth);

      const card = chart.setCardHtml();
      card.setStyle("imageCircleRect");
      card.setCardImageField("avatar");
      card.setCardDisplay([["label"], ["birthday"]]);
      card.setCardDim({ h: 80, w: 220 });
      card.setOnHoverPathToMain();
      card.setOnCardClick((_e: MouseEvent, d: any) => {
        const id = String(d?.id ?? d?.data?.id ?? "");
        if (!id) return;
        chart.updateMainId(id);
        chart.updateTree({ tree_position: "main_to_middle", transition_time: t });
        onSelectRef.current?.(id);
      });

      chartRef.current = chart;
      apiRef.current = {
        setMain: (id) => {
          chart.updateMainId(id);
          chart.updateTree({ tree_position: "main_to_middle", transition_time: t });
        },
        zoomIn: () => f3.handlers.manualZoom({ amount: 1.25, svg: chart.svg, transition_time: t }),
        zoomOut: () => f3.handlers.manualZoom({ amount: 0.8, svg: chart.svg, transition_time: t }),
        fit: () => chart.updateTree({ tree_position: "fit", transition_time: t }),
        centerMain: () =>
          chart.updateTree({ tree_position: "main_to_middle", transition_time: t }),
        setOrientation: (vertical) => {
          vertical ? chart.setOrientationVertical() : chart.setOrientationHorizontal();
          chart.updateTree({ tree_position: "fit", transition_time: t });
        },
      };

      chart.setOrientationVertical();
      if (mainId) chart.updateMainId(mainId);
      chart.updateTree({ initial: true, tree_position: "fit", transition_time: t });
    })().catch((err) => console.error("family chart init failed:", err));

    return () => {
      destroyed = true;
      chartRef.current = null;
      apiRef.current = null;
      if (container) container.innerHTML = "";
    };
  // chart is created once per mounted dataset; FamilyExplorer remounts the
  // canvas (key=tree slug) when the dataset changes.
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [data]);

  // follow external main-person changes
  useEffect(() => {
    const chart = chartRef.current;
    if (!chart || !mainId) return;
    chart.updateMainId(mainId);
    chart.updateTree({ tree_position: "main_to_middle", transition_time: t });
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [mainId]);

  return { containerRef, apiRef };
}
```

> Dev-verify during Task 9: `setStyle("imageCircleRect")` + `setCardImageField("avatar")` render the photo with the default person icon as fallback; if dims look off, tune `setCardDim` then — values are a starting point, not gospel.

#### Task 7: `PersonDetailPanel` (panel + mobile bottom sheet)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/family/PersonDetailPanel.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 7.1: Write the component** (replaces `PersonInfoPanel`; props-driven, no window events; photo + initials fallback; living-person birth dates shown as year only — interim privacy rule from A5.3; relations clickable):

```tsx

#### Task 10: Theme tokens + family-chart light/dark CSS

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/styles/index.css` (replace the single `--color-family-canvas` definition)
- Create: `src/styles/family-chart-theme.css`

- [ ] **Step 10.1: Theme the canvas token** — in `src/styles/index.css`, change `--color-family-canvas: #212121;` to a light value and add a dark override alongside the existing dark-mode pattern:

```css
/* in the :root / @theme block */
--color-family-canvas: #f1f5f9;   /* slate-100 — light mode canvas */

/* with the other .dark overrides */
.dark { --color-family-canvas: #1a1f29; }
```

(If the project's Tailwind v4 `@theme` block can't be overridden per-class, define `--color-family-canvas` as a plain CSS custom property on `:root`/`.dark` and keep the `bg-family-canvas` utility mapped to `var(--color-family-canvas)`.)

- [ ] **Step 10.2: Create `src/styles/family-chart-theme.css`** and import it from `index.css` (`@import "./family-chart-theme.css";`):

```css
/* Light/dark theming for family-chart (.f3) to match the portfolio palette. */
.f3 {
  --f3-card-bg: #ffffff;
  --f3-card-text: #0f172a;        /* slate-900 */
  --f3-card-sub: #64748b;         /* slate-500 */
  --f3-card-border: #e2e8f0;      /* slate-200 */
  --f3-card-main: #0891b2;        /* cyan-600 — main person accent */
  --f3-link: #94a3b8;             /* slate-400 connectors */
}
.dark .f3 {
  --f3-card-bg: #1e293b;          /* slate-800 */
  --f3-card-text: #f1f5f9;
  --f3-card-sub: #94a3b8;
  --f3-card-border: #334155;
  --f3-card-main: #22d3ee;        /* cyan-400 */
  --f3-link: #475569;
}

.f3 .card-inner, .f3 .card_cont .card { /* verify exact class names in dev */
  background: var(--f3-card-bg);
  color: var(--f3-card-text);
  border: 1px solid var(--f3-card-border);
}
.f3 .link { stroke: var(--f3-link); }
.f3 .card_main .card-inner { border-color: var(--f3-card-main); box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px var(--f3-card-main); }
```

> **Dev-verify step:** open the page, inspect rendered `.f3` DOM, and adjust the selector names to what `family-chart/styles/family-chart.css` actually emits (`.card_cont`, `.card-inner`, `.card_main`, `.link` are the expected ones for HTML cards — confirm and fix in place). Check text contrast in light mode.

- [ ] **Step 10.3: Build + visual check** — `npm run build`; `npm run dev` → `/family` in both themes. Expected: light canvas/cards in light mode, dark in dark.

- [ ] **Step 10.4: Commit**

```bash
git add src/styles/index.css src/styles/family-chart-theme.css
git commit -m "feat(family): light/dark theme for family chart canvas and cards"
```

(The entire 260-line inline script — fetch, merge, hardcoded patches, skeleton toggling — is gone.)

- [ ] **Step 11.2: Manual check** — `npm run dev` with the local API running (`npm run dev` in hono-workers): `/family` renders the merged tree server-side, no `/api/v1/family` requests from the browser on load (devtools Network), search/zoom/list/sheet all work, `?p=` updates on selection and restores on reload.

(Removes: yellow banner, Astro-Dropdown DOM injection, both inline scripts, fixed `w-64` panel, the "No Spouse" checkbox — spouse links are core information; YAGNI for a public viewer.)

- [ ] **Step 12.2: Manual check** — `/family/hafiz-family` works; `/family/nonexistent` returns 404 status with friendly state; mobile layout sane at 375 px.

- [ ] **Step 12.3: Build + commit**

```bash
npm run build
git add "src/pages/family/[slug]/index.astro"
git commit -m "feat(family): SSR single-tree page with proper 404 and responsive explorer"
```

### Phase 4 — Cleanup, accessibility pass, docs

#### Task 13: Delete dead components

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/components/family/CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx`
- Delete: `src/components/family/PublicFamilyExplorer.tsx`
- Delete: `src/components/family/PersonInfoPanel.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 13.1: Verify nothing imports them**

Run: `grep -rn "CombinedFamilyExplorer\|PublicFamilyExplorer\|PersonInfoPanel" src/`
Expected: no hits outside the three files themselves.

- [ ] **Step 13.2: Delete, build, commit**

```bash
rm src/components/family/CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx src/components/family/PublicFamilyExplorer.tsx src/components/family/PersonInfoPanel.tsx
npm run build
git add -A src/components/family
git commit -m "chore(family): remove superseded explorer/panel components"
```

#### Task 14: Accessibility verification pass

**Files:** touch-ups only in components from Phase 3 as findings require.

- [ ] **Step 14.1:** Walk the B6 checklist on `/family` and `/family/[slug]` (keyboard only, then VoiceOver spot-check, then `prefers-reduced-motion` emulation in devtools). Fix findings in place.
- [ ] **Step 14.2:** Lighthouse a11y audit in devtools — target ≥ 95 on both pages. Note remaining items (the SVG tree itself won't be fully screen-reader navigable; List view is the documented alternative).
- [ ] **Step 14.3:** Commit fixes: `git commit -am "fix(family): accessibility pass findings"`

#### Task 15: Update CLAUDE.md (stale sections)

**Files:**
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md` (sections "Family tree", "Public family pages")

- [ ] **Step 15.1: Rewrite the two family sections** to describe reality: SSR request-time fetching in frontmatter, `FamilyExplorer` island and props-based state, `useFamilyChart` hook, themed canvas, the admin-only window-event contract retained in `FamilyTreeChart`, merge in `src/lib/family-merge.ts` + config in `src/data/family.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 15.2: Commit**

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: update CLAUDE.md family architecture sections"
```

### Phase 5 (OPTIONAL, separate approval — backend changes in hono-workers)

Not required for the redesign to ship; listed for completeness per the data-model review:

1. Migration `008_family_quality.sql`: `ALTER TABLE family_people ADD COLUMN birth_order INTEGER;` + backfill from metadata; `ALTER TABLE family_people ADD COLUMN visibility TEXT CHECK(visibility IN ('public','private')) DEFAULT 'public';`
2. Public service filters `visibility = 'public'`; admin UI exposes both fields.
3. Frontend: sort children by `birthOrder` column; pass private people to `setPrivateCardsConfig` (if ever exposed to members-only views).

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| family-chart card image/style API details differ from plan code (`setStyle`, `setCardDim` keys, `.f3` CSS class names) | Medium | Tasks 5/10 include explicit dev-verify steps; adjust in place — the API surface is confirmed from shipped `.d.ts` files, only cosmetic params may need tuning |
| Phase 0 data fix happens in production D1; mistakes affect the live site | Medium | Run `--local` first, verify with SELECTs, KV cache gives a 2-min grace; statements are `INSERT OR IGNORE`/targeted UPDATEs |
| Combined-view merged person IDs are unstable across data changes → `?p=` links break | Low | Deep links prefer `globalKey`; numeric id is only a fallback |
| Admin regression via shared `FamilyTreeChart` edits (Tasks 3–4) | Medium | Props/events kept identical; explicit admin smoke test in Task 4.3; cross-tree deletion verified unused by grep |
| SSR fetch adds TTFB; API cold/unreachable → error page | Low | API is KV-cached (120 s) + HTTP SWR; server-rendered error state is honest and instant; previously the page failed client-side anyway |
| Same-named people without `global_key` still merge incorrectly | Low after Phase 0 | Phase 0 backfills keys; fallback documented in `family-merge.ts` |
| `prerender = false` on Cloudflare means every visit hits the worker | Accepted | Matches the rest of the site's model; data freshness wanted |

## Testing checklist (final, before review)

- [ ] `npm run build` — zero TypeScript/build errors
- [ ] `/family`: tree renders SSR-fast; tabs link to slug pages; search → select centers person; zoom buttons actually zoom (not spacing); Fit/Center work; orientation toggle works
- [ ] `/family/[slug]`: valid slug renders; bogus slug → 404 + friendly state; back link works
- [ ] Deep link: select person → URL gains `?p=`; reload restores selection; link with `?p=<globalKey>` works on combined view
- [ ] Mobile (375 px, devtools + real device if possible): toolbar wraps cleanly, pinch/pan works, person sheet opens/closes (tap, Escape, backdrop), List view usable
- [ ] Light + dark mode: canvas/cards themed correctly, AA contrast on card text
- [ ] Empty state: temporarily point `PUBLIC_API_URL` at a dead port → server-rendered error state on both pages (no infinite skeleton)
- [ ] Admin smoke: `/admin/family` list, builder chart click/select/inline-add still work; no public-API fetch storm on card clicks
- [ ] Reduced motion: emulate in devtools → no chart animation
- [ ] Lighthouse: a11y ≥ 95; perf check that no `family*noCache*` requests appear anywhere

## Files expected to change

**portfolio-astro (this repo)**

| Change | File |
|---|---|
| Modify | `src/lib/family.ts` |
| Create | `src/lib/family-merge.ts`, `src/data/family.ts` |
| Create | `src/components/family/chart-data.ts`, `useFamilyChart.ts`, `FamilyExplorer.tsx`, `FamilyToolbar.tsx`, `PersonSearch.tsx`, `PersonDetailPanel.tsx`, `FamilyListView.tsx`, `FamilyTreeCanvas.tsx` |
| Modify (slim) | `src/components/family/FamilyTreeChart.tsx` |
| Delete | `src/components/family/CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx`, `PublicFamilyExplorer.tsx`, `PersonInfoPanel.tsx` |
| Rewrite | `src/pages/family/index.astro`, `src/pages/family/[slug]/index.astro` |
| Modify | `src/styles/index.css`; Create `src/styles/family-chart-theme.css` |
| Modify | `CLAUDE.md` |

**hono-workers:** no code changes required (Phase 0 is data-only via wrangler d1; Phase 5 optional).

## Open decisions (need your call before/while implementing)

1. **Navbar link** — `/family` is currently unlisted (reachable only by URL). Intentional privacy choice, or should "Family" be added to the public nav? Plan does not add it by default.
2. **Public exposure of living relatives** — interim rule in Task 7 shows year-only birth dates for living people. OK, or do you want full dates / or the Phase 5 `visibility` column prioritized?
3. **Phase 5 backend work** — approve separately or drop.

## Codex Execution Status — 2026-06-13

Branch: `codex/family-page-phase-0-4`

### Phase 0 — Data Fix

Status: partially done.

- Done: inspected the readable backend schema/seed files in `/Users/hafiz/Developments/hono-workers`.
- Done: confirmed the backend seed already contains stable `global_key` values for the seeded cross-tree people and parent rows for `mohd-bahtiar -> muhamad-nurhafiz` and `zarina -> muhamad-nurhafiz` in `bahtiar-family`.
- Done: added `docs/reports/family-page-phase-0-d1-verification.sql` with idempotent verification/remediation SQL.
- Skipped: no local or remote D1 write was performed from this portfolio branch. The backend repo is outside this writable workspace, and production data should be reviewed/applied separately.
- Note: `hafiz-family` does not contain the parent people in the seed, so inserting those two parent rows there would not be valid without adding people. The frontend now relies on keyed cross-tree merging rather than name patches.

### Phase 1 — Server-Side Data Layer

Status: done.

- Removed public cache-busting from `src/lib/family.ts`.
- Public family reads now use a scoped `publicGet` helper without `noCache`, timestamp params, credentials, or `cache: "no-store"` so backend KV/HTTP cache behavior is preserved.
- Added `src/data/family.ts`.
- Added pure keyed merge logic in `src/lib/family-merge.ts`.
- Added `src/lib/family-privacy.ts` so public SSR props are strict whitelist DTOs. Public island payloads now contain only tree slug/name/description/default main id, person id/display name/global key/gender/year-only living birth date/deceased death date/living status/photo URL, and relationship endpoints/type.
- Stripped notes, metadata/raw JSON blobs, first/last names, tree IDs, relationship IDs, timestamps, relationship dates, `isPrimary`, `isPublic`, `createdByUserId`, and other backend/admin-only fields from public island payloads.
- Removed frontend hardcoded person-name matching from the public family flow.

### Phase 2 — Chart Core Refactor

Status: mostly done.

- Added framework-independent chart transform in `src/lib/chart-data.ts`.
- Added reusable public chart hook in `src/hooks/useFamilyChart.ts`.
- Public chart controls now use real `family-chart` zoom handlers.
- Legacy/admin `FamilyTreeChart.tsx` also uses real zoom for its existing event API and `window.familyChartApi`.
- Removed the cross-tree N+1 fetch/navigation block from `FamilyTreeChart.tsx`.
- Kept `enableCrossTreeNavigation?: boolean` as a deprecated no-op prop to avoid breaking current admin builder props.
- Skipped: deeper shared-hook migration of the legacy admin chart. The admin chart still owns its inline-add/event behavior to reduce regression risk.

### Phase 3 — New UI

Status: done for code; pending manual QA.

- Replaced both public pages with request-time SSR data loading and one `FamilyExplorer` island per page.
- Added toolbar search, tree/list toggle, orientation, zoom in/out, fit, reset view, and center controls.
- Added desktop details panel and mobile bottom sheet with Escape/backdrop close and focus return.
- Added mobile/keyboard list fallback.
- Added avatar card support in the public chart hook and avatar/initial fallbacks in details/list views.
- Added `?p=<globalKey>` deep-link syncing/restoration and fixed chart initialization so deep links selected before async chart load still center correctly.
- Added 404, empty, and error states.
- Removed the yellow debug banner and fixed-width public side panel.
- Kept `/family` unlisted from the public navbar.
- Skipped: expand/depth controls in the UI because `family-chart` only provides global depth settings and no clean per-branch collapse API.

### Phase 4 — Cleanup, Accessibility, Docs

Status: done for code/docs; pending manual accessibility audit.

- Deleted superseded public components after confirming imports were removed:
  - `src/components/family/CombinedFamilyExplorer.tsx`
  - `src/components/family/PublicFamilyExplorer.tsx`
  - `src/components/family/PersonInfoPanel.tsx`
- Updated stale `CLAUDE.md` family architecture notes.
- Added this execution status and the handoff report at `docs/reports/family-page-codex-handoff.md`.
- Accessibility implemented in code: labels on icon buttons, combobox roles/keyboard support, dialog role/Escape close/focus return for mobile sheet, list fallback, focus rings, reduced-motion handling in chart hook.
- Broader public payload sensitive-field minimization is done in code through the strict public DTO sanitizer.
- Not manually completed: browser/VoiceOver/Lighthouse responsive audits. Build passes, but visual and assistive-tech verification should be done by the next reviewer.

### Verification

- `npm run build`: passed.
- Follow-up `npm run build` after final local patches: passed.
- Privacy DTO follow-up `npm run build`: passed.
- Privacy DTO follow-up `git diff --check`: passed.
- `npm run`: confirmed no `lint`, `typecheck`, or test scripts exist.
- Manual browser testing: not completed in this pass.
